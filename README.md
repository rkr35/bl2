# bl2
A hook for Borderlands 2 that facilitates in-game modifications.

## Objective
Provide a complete [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) workspace that allows one to generate an SDK to [Borderlands 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borderlands_2).

The generated SDK should provide enough information for a developer to produce custom modifications for the game using Rust.

The workspace will provide an example of such modifications in the root crate.
